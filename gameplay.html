                    <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>Lemmings is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other. Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The goal of each level is to guide at least a portion of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use. Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if it hits an obstacle it cannot pass.</p>

                <div class="col-8">
                    <p>A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from too great a height, drowning or falling into lava, falling off the bottom edge of the screen, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill.</p>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p> Every level has a time limit; if the timer expires, the level ends and the player is evaluated on the number of lemmings rescued.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>To successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings.</p>
                    <p>Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row mb-4">
                <div class="col-9">
                    <p> There are eight skills that can be assigned: Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang.</p>
                    <p>Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights.</p>
                    <p>Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps.</p>
                    <p>Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction.</p>
                    <p>Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers tunnel horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively, but cannot break through steel barriers.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>While the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate.</p>
                    <p>The player also has the option to "nuke" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers.[18] This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The four difficulty groups – "Fun", "Tricky", "Taxing" and "Mayhem" – are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty. This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved.</p>
                    <p>Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.</p>

                    <h2>Two Player Mode</h2>
                    <p>The original Lemmings also has 20 two-player levels.</p>
                    <p>This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and has their own base.</p>
                    <p>The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.</p>

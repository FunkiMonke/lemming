                <p>Lemmings inspired several further games in the franchise, including the Christmas Lemmings short games that were released between 1991 and 1994, and the 1991 expansion Oh No! More Lemmings.</p>
                <p> Stand-alone sequels were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lemmings 2: The Tribes (1993)</li>
                    <li>All New World of Lemmings (1994)</li>
                    <li>3D Lemmings (1995)</li>
                    <li>Lemmings Revolution (2000)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> By mid-1995, Lemmings and its sequels had accumulated combined sales of more than 4 million units worldwide. Two spin-off games were also made, both in 1996; Lemmings Paintball  and The Adventures of Lomax.</p>
                <p>Numerous clones of Lemmings were made, including The Humans (1992) and Pingus (1998). Other similar games include Clones (2009), which was described by the developed as "a multiplayer version of Lemmings". Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, commenting on the 2014 game MouseCraft which incorporates elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as the pace of the game is far too slow to satisfy most players.</p>

                <p>In 2004, Graham Cormode proved that deciding whether it is possible to complete a level of Lemmings is NP-hard. Later, Giovanni Viglietta showed that the task is PSPACE-complete, even for levels where there is only one lemming to save.</p> 
                <p>In 2010, it was announced that Lemmings would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP, though Sony Computer Entertainment Europe later presented them with a cease-and-desist letter, forcing them to halt development of the port. Mobile 1UP reworked the game to replace the Lemmings with humans in a prehistoric setting, and instead released the game under the name Caveman in 2011. Brutal Deluxe, the developer who did the porting of the Apple IIGS version of Lemmings, has released the port's source code.</p>

                <p>Lemmings has also been called a predecessor of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said that part of the inspiration for the first Warcraft game, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other."Lemmings' introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons? Can't imagine how anyone thought that... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk, I overwrote it so I couldn't get it back."</p>
                <p>Lemmings was one of six games featured in a stamp series issued by the Royal Mail in 2020 to pay tribute to the United Kingdom's early video game industry.</p>
